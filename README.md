Machine Learning — Applied Labs & Experiments

This repository contains a collection of applied machine learning labs completed as part of the ARI 510: Machine Learning course. The work focuses on understanding how different models behave in practice, how performance is evaluated, and how design choices impact results.

What’s Covered:

Supervised learning models (classification and regression)

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Model training, validation, and evaluation

Comparison of models using accuracy, F1 score, and other metrics

Error analysis and interpretation of results

Tools & Technologies:

Python | Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn | Jupyter Notebooks

Key Takeaways: 

Gained hands-on experience selecting appropriate models based on data and problem constraints

Learned to evaluate models beyond accuracy, focusing on trade-offs and generalization

Developed an experimental mindset by iterating on features, parameters, and evaluation strategies

Notes:

These labs emphasize practical understanding and experimentation rather than production deployment. They reflect my approach to learning machine learning concepts through hands-on analysis and measurable results.
